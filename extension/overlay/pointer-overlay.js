// Agent pointer overlay — design.md decision 5c / task 5.9, redesigned per
// openspec/changes/redesign-remote-control-overlay (the "Aurora" direction),
// then repaired per openspec/changes/repair-overlay-mount-and-visibility
// (eager mount, single visibility authority, correlated capture lease,
// cursor easing, unscoped-run raise, extraction exclusion, operator-input
// blocking, the wait cursor, the ambient glow, the larger cursor).
//
// Renders the agent's cursor and an active-control notice (with a Stop
// button) on the page the agent is actually controlling. Driven ENTIRELY by
// the action-event stream extension/events/action-events.js already emits
// in-process inside the service worker (Batch 1 of this split), plus the
// approval-request/decision bridge extension/background.js relays alongside
// it; this file never invents a pointer position, a click, an "active"
// state, or an approval decision that a real dispatched/relayed event did
// not already report.
//
// WHY THIS IS A CLASSIC (non-module) SCRIPT, NOT AN ES MODULE:
// extension/manifest.json is frozen for this task (owned by a different
// batch) and has no `web_accessible_resources` entry, and Chrome requires a
// dynamic `import()` from a content script to be declared there (verified:
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/web_accessible_resources
// and the chromium-extensions group's own guidance on the topic) — so this
// file is injected the exact same way `extension/content.js` already is
// (`chrome.scripting.executeScript({ target:{tabId}, files:[...] })`, the
// SAME retry-after-inject shape `sendContentMessage()` in
// extension/background.js already uses), and is written as one big IIFE
// with named top-level function declarations for exactly one reason: so
// `test/_extract.mjs`'s brace-matching extractor (the SAME technique
// test/handlers.test.mjs and test/action-events-emission.test.mjs already
// use for extension/background.js) can pull each pure function out of THIS
// REAL SHIPPED FILE and unit-test it in plain Node, without a bundler, a
// second copy of the logic, or a real browser.
//
// SECTIONS BELOW:
//   1. Pure geometry/state/scheduling functions (no chrome.*, no DOM) —
//      extractable and unit-tested directly.
//   2. DOM construction + paint (touches `document`) — unit-tested against
//      a minimal hand-rolled DOM fake, matching the rest of this codebase's
//      testing convention (no jsdom/puppeteer dependency exists here).
//   3. Messaging + lifecycle wiring — thin glue, proven structurally
//      (call-order regex checks on the shipped source) rather than executed,
//      the same way extension/background.js's own `handleToolRequest` is
//      proven (too much of a live dependency graph — chrome.tabs,
//      chrome.scripting, chrome.runtime — to usefully execute offline).
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: an Allow/Deny control for the approval-pending
// state. See design.md decision D6 and the "waiting" bar state below —
// the agent's own clicks are dispatched via CDP Input.dispatchMouseEvent
// (extension/background.js), which is browser-level synthetic input: it
// carries isTrusted===true and lands on whatever occupies the coordinate,
// closed shadow roots included. A grant control on this surface would sit
// inside the pointer reach of the very agent asking for the grant. The
// waiting state gets an "Open panel" control and nothing else.
//
// ONE WRITER PER PROPERTY (design.md "Goals", correcting an earlier draft
// that claimed paintOverlay() is the only function that touches the DOM —
// that was never true: createOverlayHost(), attach() and setCapturedHidden()
// all did, and this revision adds setWaitCursorActive() and
// paintCursorPosition() deliberately). The real invariant, held throughout
// this file: exactly one function ever writes a given DOM property.
// paintOverlay() owns everything except host.style.left/top (owned solely by
// the cursor-easing loop's paintCursorPosition(), so the coalesced paint and
// the per-frame easing never fight over the same two properties) and the
// page-level wait-cursor <style> element (owned solely by
// setWaitCursorActive()).

(function () {
  // Same reasoning as extension/content.js's own disposer — see the long note
  // there. A plain "already loaded, bail" guard survives an extension reload
  // (the flag lives on the page's isolated-world `window`, the listener does
  // not), so after every reload this document could never get a working
  // overlay again: the newly injected copy returned at this line, and the page
  // being driven showed no cursor, no badge and no Stop button for the rest of
  // its life. Disposing instead handles both a live double-injection and a

  // — it does not wait for a new event to notice staleness, because the
  // whole point is to cover the case where NO new event ever arrives again
  // (a dead companion, a crashed service worker, a lost native-messaging
  // connection). MAX_AGE + CHECK_INTERVAL is kept under 3000ms so the worst

   * now" — a `keepalive` (nothing dispatched) arrives on the same 1s timer
   * whether or not an action is currently open, so it cannot be read as
   * "settle" either. `actionInFlight` is the one field that exists only to
