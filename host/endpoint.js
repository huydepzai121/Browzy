// A named pipe on Windows, a unix socket on POSIX, named deterministically from
// the username. There is no number to allocate, so there is no EADDRINUSE race
// and nothing for a stale process to squat; and the OS scopes it to the user,
// where a loopback TCP port is reachable by any process any local user is
// running — worth caring about, since every call across this bridge drives a
// real browser holding real logged-in sessions.
//
// This replaced a shared TCP port. The port is gone rather than deprecated:
// keeping both alive meant keeping the election, the yield protocol and the
// peer-classification sniff alive with it, which is most of what used to go
// wrong here.
