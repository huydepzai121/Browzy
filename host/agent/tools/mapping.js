// SDK-facing operation-name mapping and borrowed-tab scope (design.md task
// group 6, decisions 5b and 6).
//
// Two independent jobs, both scoped to the SDK path only:
//
// 1. Friendly-name mapping (decision 6): "Map SDK-facing friendly aliases
//    back to legacy names without changing executor schemas... Legacy names
//    containing mcp remain internal compatibility aliases only." The three
//    `_mcp`-suffixed legacy names (tabs_context_mcp, tabs_create_mcp,
//    tabs_close_mcp) get real, tested, bidirectional friendly aliases here.
//
//    IMPORTANT, and recorded rather than silently worked around: the actual
//    SDK tool() REGISTRATION in host/agent/tools/adapter.js still registers
//    under the legacy name, not the friendly one. host/test/
//    agent-tool-adapter.test.mjs (an existing, passing, out-of-scope-to-edit
//    suite from task group 3) asserts byte-identical registration — the set
//    of registered tool names equals TOOLS.map(t => t.name) exactly, with no
//    substitutions and no extra/duplicate entries. Renaming the registration
//    would break that suite, which this change's acceptance criteria require
//    to keep passing. So this module's mapping is real, bidirectional, and
//    exercised by its own tests (test/registry-sdk-mapping.test.mjs) as the
//    resolution layer any future SDK-facing caller (or a later, deliberate
//    registration-name change) would use — it is wired into
//    host/agent/tools/adapter.js today for description text (see
//    sdkFacingDescription below), not for the registered identifier.
//
// 2. Borrowed-tab scope (decision 5b): "Adapt the SDK path to a validated
//    per-run borrowed-tab scope... Bound article reading gets read-only
//    access to that tab; mutations need authorization from the actual user
//    task... Shared tool handlers must distinguish borrowed tabs from
//    agent-created tabs so cleanup never closes or regroups borrowed tabs."
//    This lives here — not in host/agent/session/run.js or
//    host/agent/broker/browser-lease.js, both outside this task's file
//    ownership — as WeakMaps keyed by the Run instance, so nothing about
//    Run's shape or constructor needs to change: any object with a stable
//    identity works as a WeakMap key. Legacy MCP clients never construct a
//    Run at all (host/mcp-server.js and host/codemode/* call
//    host/tool-runtime.js directly, with no runId), so every function below
//    is structurally inert for them.
