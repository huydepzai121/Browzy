// Isolated `query()` Options builder, productionized from
// host/agent/spike/lib/query-options.mjs (see reports/01-sdk-gate-evidence.md
// gate 1.6 for the empirically-verified isolation contract this preserves
// byte-for-byte: `env` REPLACES rather than merges with process.env,
// `settingSources: []`, `strictMcpConfig: true`, and a defense-in-depth
// `disallowedTools` list).
//
// `settingSources: []` is NOT the whole discoverability story any more
// (design.md decision 9, superseding decision 7): a session's approved
// skill snapshots are made discoverable via the SEPARATE `plugins` option
// (an explicit absolute-path load, added below in buildIsolatedOptions()),
// never by widening `settingSources`. Decision 7 tried adding `'project'`
// to `settingSources` and a real, unmocked `query()` proved it walks the
// ENTIRE ancestor directory tree with no repo-root gating at all - see
// plans/reports/blocker-260909-0712-project-settingsource-walkup-leak.md and
// host/test/skills-scope-verification.test.mjs. `settingSources` therefore
// stays `[]` here, untouched, exactly as this file's isolation baseline
// always intended; `plugins` has no ancestor walk-up of any kind (proven by
// host/test/skills-plugin-scope-verification.test.mjs) and is the ONLY
// discovery path added by this design.
//
// The one real change from the spike: credentials/model now come from the
// settings profile module (host/agent/settings/profile.js, owned by the
// parallel task-group-4 session — see its documented contract in this
// change's task-group-3 delegation) via `snapshotForRun(profileId, modelId)`,
// instead of being passed in directly by a gate script. That module does not
// exist yet in this working tree; `resolveProfileSnapshot` takes an
// injectable `profileProvider` so this file's own tests can exercise the
// full run-start path today with a local double that matches the documented
// contract exactly, while production code (host/agent/session/run.js) uses
// the default lazy dynamic import — so nothing here breaks or silently
// no-ops once group 4 lands the real module, and nothing here fails to
// import today because the import only happens when a run actually starts,
// never at module load time.
//
// Task 7.2's remaining gap (reports/10-task-reconciliation.md): this module
// used to hard-code `tools: []`, which also disabled the SDK's `Skill` tool,
// and accepted no skills-related parameter at all — the application-owned
// skills catalog (host/agent/skills/**) was fully built and tested but never
// reached a real `query()` call. Fixed by requiring a `skills` parameter
// (the caller's session binding — see host/agent/companion.js's
// `_bindSkillsForRun()`, which composes `buildSessionSkills()`'s output with
// the conversation's workspace directory): `skills.cwd` becomes the SDK
// `cwd` option (this run's own conversation workspace, never the companion
// process's own cwd shared across every conversation), `skills.pluginDir` —
// buildSessionSkills()'s materialized local plugin directory for THIS
// session — is what the SDK actually discovers, via the separate `plugins`
// option below (see its own comment; this is no longer routed through `cwd`/
// `.claude` scanning at all — see design.md decision 9), `skills.allowedSkillNames`
// becomes the `skills` allowlist option, `skills.skillOverrides` becomes the
// `skillOverrides` option, and
// `"Skill"` is added to the explicit `tools` list (sdk.d.ts's `skills` option
// docstring, around line 2088: "you do not need to add 'Skill' to
// `allowedTools` yourself when using this option" — this is about
// `allowedTools`, the SEPARATE auto-approval field described below, not the
// `tools` availability allowlist this isolation contract uses; `tools` is
// what actually gates which built-ins exist at all, per its own docstring, so
// `Skill` must be listed there explicitly for the tool to be invocable. Correction: an earlier revision of this comment
// misread that citation as calling `allowedTools` itself deprecated — it does
// not. Only passing `'Skill'` through `allowedTools` is deprecated
// (sdk.d.ts:1447, `Options.allowedTools`'s own docstring: "Note: passing
// 'Skill' here is deprecated — use the `skills` option instead"); `Skill` is
// therefore added to `tools` here but deliberately never to `allowedTools`
// below).
//
// This does NOT change the actual security boundary: per sdk.d.ts:2108's own
// docstring, `skills`/`skillOverrides` are "a context filter, not a sandbox"
// — unlisted skills are hidden from the model and rejected by the Skill tool,
// but their files remain reachable via Read/Bash if either were enabled.
// `Bash`/`Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` remain in `disallowedTools` below
// (HIGH_RISK_BUILTINS) exactly as before — filesystem writes and arbitrary
// command execution stay disabled by default, a deliberate project property.
// (`Task`, `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` were later moved OUT of
// HIGH_RISK_BUILTINS and into `tools`/`allowedTools`/`canUseTool` — see the
// comments at each of those below for the current, narrower risk story.)
// `Read` is deliberately NOT added to `tools` here — "keeping ... arbitrary
// filesystem reads ... disabled by default" (this task's own non-negotiable)
// stays true regardless of how many skills are enabled. The actual
// authorization boundary for explicit slash dispatch is
// `assertSlashDispatchAllowed()`, enforced application-side in
// host/agent/companion.js BEFORE this function (and therefore the SDK) is
// ever reached — never delegated to what the SDK's `skills` option merely
// chooses to display.
//
// Regression fixed here (first pass, incomplete — see reports/11 for the
// full history): adding `"Skill"` above made `tools` a single-built-in
// allowlist (`["Skill"]`), which — per the same `tools` docstring cited above
// ("Specify the base set of available built-in tools... `string[]` - Array
// of specific tool names") — left every browser MCP tool this adapter
// registers (`mcp__${SDK_MCP_SERVER_NAME}__read_page`, `__navigate`,
// `__computer`, etc. — see host/agent/tools/adapter.js's `buildSdkTools()`)
// outside that allowlist, so it was not even *available* to the model.
// `buildIsolatedOptions()` appended every registered browser tool's
// fully-qualified SDK name (from `sdkQualifiedToolNames()`, itself derived
// from the same `TOOLS` array `buildSdkTools()` registers from, so the two
// can never drift apart) to `tools`.
//
// That first pass was still incomplete and shipped a live regression: making
// a tool *available* via `tools` is a different axis from making it
// *auto-approved* via `allowedTools` (sdk.d.ts:1443-1449, `Options.
// allowedTools`'s own docstring: "List of tool names that are auto-allowed
// without prompting for permission... To restrict which tools are available,
// use the `tools` option instead"). With every browser tool present in
// `tools` but absent from `allowedTools`, and with no `canUseTool` callback
// and no `permissionMode` set (both still unset here), each call fell
// through to the SDK's default permission path — which prompts for
// permission and, with nothing able to answer that prompt in this headless
// companion process, denies the call. This is exactly the reproduced
// failure: "Claude requested permissions to use
// mcp__browzy-in-chrome-browser__get_page_text, but you haven't granted
// it yet" on every single browser tool call, surviving a full browser
// restart and a companion respawn, because the bug was in the `query()`
// options themselves, not stale in-memory state.
//
// The complete fix: `buildIsolatedOptions()` now also appends the identical
// `qualifiedBrowserToolNames` (the same array, from the same
// `sdkQualifiedToolNames()` call — availability and auto-approval can never
// drift apart because both read the one array) to `allowedTools`, so every
// registered browser tool is both available (`tools`) and auto-approved
// (`allowedTools`), preapproving them at the SDK layer exactly as design.md's
// SDK integration decision calls for ("SDK-managed browser tools with no
// mandatory user MCP setup"). `"Skill"` is deliberately NOT added to
// `allowedTools` — per `allowedTools`'s own docstring, "passing `'Skill'`
// here is deprecated — use the `skills` option instead", and the `skills`
// option (already wired above) documents that it already covers this
// ("you do not need to add `'Skill'` to `allowedTools` yourself when using
// this option", sdk.d.ts around line 2088).
//
// This does not relax anything: per that same design.md decision, "Validate
// run state, arguments, browser lease, and tab scope inside each tool
// handler, even when SDK permission checks preapprove the tool" —
// host/agent/tools/adapter.js's `authorizeToolCall()` and
// `enforceBorrowedTabScope()` run unconditionally on every dispatched call
// and are the real authorization boundary; SDK preapproval (both `tools` and
// `allowedTools`) only lets a legitimate call reach that boundary at all,
// without a UI permission round trip nothing in this headless companion
// process could ever answer.
//
// `permissionMode` is deliberately left unset (SDK default): setting a
// blanket mode like `bypassPermissions` would also preapprove
// `HIGH_RISK_BUILTINS` (now just `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `NotebookEdit` —
// see that constant below) and anything else not explicitly disallowed — far
// broader than the browser tools plus WebSearch/Task this file actually needs
// to preapprove, and broader than WebFetch, which must NOT be blanket-
// preapproved (see its own comment below).
//
// CORRECTION — this paragraph replaces two paragraphs that used to say
// `canUseTool` was "deliberately left unset" with "no wire protocol" to the
// panel. That was true when first written and is NOT true anymore: task 9.2
// wired it up.
// `host/agent/policy/can-use-tool.js`'s `createCanUseTool({run, approvals,
// requestIdTracker, now})` IS the real `canUseTool` callback; companion.js
// builds one per run and passes it as this function's `canUseTool` parameter
// (which flows straight into `Options.canUseTool` below). It classifies each
// call via `isSendClassCall()`, auto-allows anything that isn't send-class,
// and for a send-class call emits a real `approval_request` stream event and
// awaits the panel's `approval_decision` over the native-messaging wire (or
// the registry's timeout) — this is a real interactive round trip, not a
// stub. `allowedTools` still answers every call this project intends to
// auto-approve without ever reaching `canUseTool` at all; `canUseTool` is
// the path for the calls that are deliberately NOT in `allowedTools`
// (`computer`/`javascript_tool` send-class calls, and now `WebFetch` — see
// below).

import { sdkQualifiedToolNames, SDK_MCP_SERVER_NAME } from "./adapter.js";
import { createWebFetchPreToolUseHook } from "../policy/webfetch-url-guard.js";

// Filesystem writes and arbitrary command execution stay disabled by
// default — that is this project's own non-negotiable, unchanged by the
// WebSearch/WebFetch/Task enablement below. `Task`, `WebFetch` and
// `WebSearch` used to be listed here too; they were moved out (added to
// `tools` below, and to `allowedTools` for WebSearch/Task) because none of
// the three opens a filesystem or shell door: `Task` spawns a subagent
// inside this same sandboxed run (no new external capability), `WebSearch`
// is read-only, and `WebFetch` is gated per-call by `canUseTool` (see the

// blanket-disallowed or blanket-preapproved.

// --- Bound page-context channel (design.md section 5 / 5b) ---------------
//
// Deviation fixed: extension/sidepanel/context-binding.js used to compose a
// `<bound_page_context>` block directly into the wire "prompt" text, because
// neither this file nor host/agent/companion.js exposed a separate context
// or system-prompt hook. That contradicted design.md section 5 ("User
// messages and page/tool content remain distinctly typed") and 5b (the bound
// context must be supplied as "structured trusted metadata").
//
// The pinned SDK's own `Options.systemPrompt` field (see
// host/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/sdk.d.ts, `Options` type,
// around line 2237: `systemPrompt?: string | string[] | { type: 'custom',
// prompt: string | string[], snapshot?: boolean } | { type: 'preset', preset:
// 'claude_code', append?: string, excludeDynamicSections?: boolean,
// snapshot?: boolean }`) is the documented per-`query()` channel for exactly
// this: content that reaches the model OUTSIDE the user's own turn. This
// module renders the bound-context metadata (a plain data object carried
// over the wire on the `start` envelope's `context` field — see
// panel-controller.js's `sendMessage()` and companion.js's `_handleStart()`)
// into that field, using the `{ type: 'custom', prompt }` form: a bare
// string/array `systemPrompt` and an omitted `snapshot` are both
// "recording off" per the same doc block, i.e. rendered fresh on every
// `query()` call — exactly right, since each run's bound tab/URL can differ
// from the last and this project calls `query()` once per run (see
// companion.js's `_runQuery`), never SDK-level `resume`/`continue`.
//
// The actual live-extraction/scope enforcement this metadata's instruction
// text merely *reinforces* remains entirely code-side (borrowed-tab
// read-only default, stale/restricted detection in
// extension/background.js's `checkTabReadableForExtraction()`, tab-scope
// binding via `Run.tabScope`) — this text can only ever request that the
// model call get_page_text/read_page; it grants no capability and is never
// treated as authorization by itself (design.md decision 1: "Prompt
// instructions reinforce page-content distrust, while code enforces scope
// and permission decisions").

/**
 * @param {object|null} pageContext - the structured metadata object produced

/**
 * The browser-automation operating instructions, ported from the ones Claude in
 * Chrome ships (its "Claude in Chrome browser automation" system prompt,
 * ccVersion 2.1.221). This project exposes the same tool surface, so parity
 * here is the point: the reference product's behaviour on a given prompt is
 * what this extension is measured against, and until now a run with no bound
 * page context reached the model with NO system prompt at all — its entire idea
 * of how to drive a browser came from the per-tool descriptions in
 * host/tool-definitions.js, which describe each tool in isolation.
 *
 * TWO SECTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL ARE DELIBERATELY NOT PORTED:
 *
 *  - "Loading deferred tools". That section exists because Claude Code defers
 *    those tools behind ToolSearch. Here every browser tool is registered up
 *    front on the run's own MCP server (see buildIsolatedOptions below), so
 *    there is nothing to load and the instruction would name a tool that does
 *    not exist in this runtime.
 *  - "GIF recording". `gif_creator` is a stub in this extension — its handler
 *    in extension/background.js returns "GIF recording is not yet implemented
 *    in this extension." Porting an instruction to ALWAYS record would make
 *    the model open every multi-step task with a call that cannot succeed.
 *    Restore this section together with a real implementation, not before.
 *
 * ONE SECTION IS ADDED that the original has no equivalent of: "Working
 * visibly on the page". This is a product requirement, not a workaround, and it
 * was reached the long way round — the history is worth keeping so it is not
 * re-litigated:
 *
 *   - The tool descriptions were ruled out as the cause: Claude in Chrome's own
 *     `computer`, `find`, `get_page_text` and `form_input` descriptions were
 *     read directly and compared against host/tool-definitions.js. They are the
 *     same text apart from trivia (`duration` capped at 10 rather than 30, the
 *     `save_to_disk` wording, and read_page truncating at a line boundary where
 *     ours raises an error).
 *   - One real divergence of ours WAS found and fixed on its own merits: the
 *     bound-page-context block below used to instruct a read before answering
 *     any request that merely "concerned" the page, including a request to
 *     operate it. It now fires only for questions about the page's content.
 *   - That fix alone did not produce the behaviour. Note also that the ported
 *     prompt above is Claude Code's browser-automation prompt, while the
 *     behaviour being matched was observed in the claude.ai app — a different
 *     surface with its own system prompt, which is not available to copy. So
 *     "same prompt, different behaviour" was never quite established.
 *
 * What remains is a genuine product requirement, stated plainly by the person
 * who owns this product: the user is watching in their own browser, and seeing
 * the work happen on the page is part of what they are asking for. A model that
 * reads the DOM and hand-assembles a result URL can be correct and still fail
 * that requirement. Hence the section. Removing it because it is "not in the
 * reference prompt" would regress a deliberate decision.
 *
 * The section names SPECIFIC mechanisms, not just an outcome, and it took two
 * passes to get them right. The first pass made screenshot-plus-coordinate the
 * only route and demoted `find` to a fallback alongside `read_page`. That was
 * wrong, and the evidence had been sitting in front of us the whole time: the
 * reference product's own action list, which the user screenshotted, opens with
 * `Finding "advanced search toggle..."` and only then Clicked, Captured. It
 * searches the page's content for the label. Lumping `find` in with `read_page`
 * confused two unlike things — `read_page` dumps an entire accessibility tree
 * (the invisible DOM operation the user objects to), while `find` looks for one
 * named thing, which is what a person does with Ctrl+F. So: a labelled control
 * is located by label, and the picture is for state, confirmation, and targets
 * that have no label to search for.
 *
 * The coordinate route still matters, and it makes extension/background.js's
 * screenshot scaling load-bearing rather than merely defensive: a coordinate
 * taken off an image is wrong the instant that image is silently resized on its
 * way to the model. See MODEL_IMAGE_MAX_EDGE and screenshotToCssCoordinate()
 * there — those two halves are one mechanism and must not be changed apart.
 *
 * ONE INSTRUCTION IS DELIBERATELY INVERTED, in "Tab context and session
 * startup". The original says to reuse an existing tab only if the user asks,
 * and otherwise to open a new one — correct for Claude Code, which drives a
 * browser the user is not sitting in front of. This assistant runs in a side
 * panel attached to the user's own browser: the page in front of them IS the
 * subject, and it arrives as the bound page context appended right after this
 * block. Following the original verbatim made it open a second copy of the page
 * the user was already reading. So the order is reversed here — use the tab
 * they are on; create one only when the page genuinely is not open yet.
 *
 * Everything else is the original's guidance, with the tool prefix resolved to
 * this project's own MCP server name so the names are the ones the model
 * actually sees.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: guidance only. It grants no capability and relaxes no
 * check — scope, permission and live-extraction stay enforced in code
 * (extension/background.js's tab-scope and restricted-page checks,
 * host/agent/policy/can-use-tool.js's approval gate), exactly as design.md
 * decision 1 requires: "Prompt instructions reinforce page-content distrust,
 * while code enforces scope and permission decisions."
 *
 * @param {string} [serverName] - the MCP server these tools are registered
 *   under, so the fully-qualified names in the text can never drift from the
 *   ones buildIsolatedOptions actually registers.
 * @returns {string} the system-prompt text.

 * @param {object} params.skills - this run's bound skills session, as produced by

 *   host/agent/skills/index.js's `buildSessionSkills()`):
 *   { cwd: string, pluginDir: string, configDir: string, allowedSkillNames: string[], skillOverrides: Record<string, string> }.
 *   `cwd` MUST be the session workspace directory passed to
 *   `buildSessionSkills()` - required, not optional, so a session can never
 *   silently reach query() without having gone through the
 *   catalog/materialization/binding path at all. `pluginDir` is the absolute
 *   path to that same call's materialized local plugin directory (a
 *   `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest plus a `skills/` subdirectory
 *   holding the approved snapshots) - this is what makes the plugin
 *   discoverable at all (see the `plugins` option below); `allowedSkillNames`
 *   now carries each skill's plugin-qualified canonical name (design.md
 *   decision 9), not the bare name. `configDir` is that same session's own
 *   isolated Claude Code CLI config directory (`buildSessionSkills()`'s
 *   `${sessionWorkspaceDir}/claude-config/`) - also required, not optional,
 *   for the identical "never silently reach query()" reason as `cwd`: without
 *   an explicit `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, the installed SDK's bundled CLI
 *   subprocess falls back to the OPERATOR's own `~/.claude` and writes real
 *   session `.jsonl` files into their actual Claude Code CLI history (a real,
 *   reproduced isolation leak - see this change's Part A evidence report).
 * @param {object|null} [params.pageContext] - this run's bound page-context
 *   metadata, forwarded verbatim from the `start` envelope's `context` field
 *   (see this file's "Bound page-context channel" section above). Rendered
 *   into the returned options' `systemPrompt`, never into the run's `prompt`.
 * @param {Function} [params.canUseTool] - task 9.2: a `canUseTool` callback
 *   (sdk.d.ts:209-269) created per-run via
 *   `host/agent/policy/can-use-tool.js`'s `createCanUseTool()`. When passed,
 *   the SDK calls it before each tool execution for any tool that is
 *   available (`tools`) but NOT auto-approved (`allowedTools`) — that is
 *   `computer` and `javascript_tool` (removed from `allowedTools` per task
 *   9.1, for their send-class calls) and, since WebSearch/WebFetch/Task were
 *   enabled, also `WebFetch` (deliberately never added to `allowedTools` —
 *   see its own comment below — so its URL is always classified here).
 *   Every other registered browser tool, plus `WebSearch` and `Task`, is
 *   auto-approved via `allowedTools` and never triggers it. The callback
 *   never resolves `null` (which the SDK warns would block the tool
 *   indefinitely) and never waits past its documented timeout.
 * @param {string|null} [params.effort] - this run's reasoning-effort level
 *   ("low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh" | "max"), already validated by
 *   host/agent/protocol.js's `validateStartEffort()`. Null (the default)
 *   sends no effort parameter at all, leaving the model's own default in
 *   force — deliberately not the same as pinning it to today's default.
 * @param {string} [params.resume] - tasks.md 2.3/2.4: the SDK `session_id`
 *   this turn should resume, already gated by
 *   `SessionManager.getResumeSessionId()` (only offered when a compatible,
 *   ACTIVE reference exists — see host/agent/companion.js's
 *   `_runAfterLeaseGranted()`) — this function performs NO compatibility or
 *   staleness check of its own, it only forwards the decision already made.
 *   Omitted (undefined) means "run a fresh SDK session", identical to every
 *   call before this task existed. `persistSession` is always explicitly
 *   `true` regardless (gate-0.2's own load-bearing finding: decision 1
 *   requires "Valid sessions use resume ... No `continue` option is used as
 *   a substitute for a durable mapping" — a session that cannot be persisted
 *   could never be resumed later, defeating the entire mapping this task
 *   builds). `forkSession` is deliberately NOT wired here — tasks.md 2.3-2.5
 *   scope is resume/reject/recover, not an explicit-branch UI; decision 1
 *   reserves `forkSession` for "a deliberate branch ... an explicit
 *   new-conversation action", which is out of this task's scope.
 * @param {number|null} [params.maxTurns] - tasks.md 5.2: forwarded as the
 *   SDK's own `maxTurns` option. Honest semantics, per gate-0.2 evidence G6:
 *   this caps the SDK's internal multi-round TOOL loop within one top-level
 *   turn (reported as `error_max_turns`), NOT paced streaming-input
 *   conversation turns — the identical paced harness that triggers
 *   `error_max_budget_usd` sailed past `maxTurns: 2` untouched. The local
 *   wall-clock/model-turn admission counter (conversationMetadata.
 *   budgetPolicy) stays authoritative regardless; this is best-effort on top.
 * @param {number|null} [params.maxBudgetUsd] - tasks.md 5.2: forwarded as
 *   the SDK's own `maxBudgetUsd` option. This is the SDK's ESTIMATED
 *   query-budget stop, never a hard provider billing ceiling (gate-0.2
 *   evidence G7: the stop lands AFTER the turn that crosses the cap — a real
 *   in-flight overrun of several multiples was observed — and the figure is
 *   a cost-table estimate per `costBasis`, not a billing statement). The
 *   panel MUST label it as such; see extension/sidepanel/usage-ledger-view.js.
 * @param {string[]} [params.browserToolNames] - the legacy names of every
 *   browser tool actually registered on `mcpServer`. Defaults to
 *   `sdkQualifiedToolNames()`'s own default (host/agent/tools/adapter.js's
 *   `adapterToolNames()`, derived from `TOOLS` — the identical array
 *   `buildSdkTools()` registers from), so production never has to pass this;
 *   exposed as a parameter only so this file's own tests can prove the
 *   allowlist tracks whatever the registry actually contains, rather than a
 *   hand-typed copy that could silently drift from it. The resulting
 *   qualified names are written into BOTH the returned `tools` (availability)
 *   and `allowedTools` (auto-approval) arrays from the one computation, so
 *   the two options can never disagree about which browser tools are usable
 *   without a permission prompt.
